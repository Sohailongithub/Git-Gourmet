## Simple and quick recipe for basic noodles:

**Ingredients:**
- 200 grams of noodles (such as egg noodles, rice noodles, or wheat noodles)
- 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil

- 2 green onions, chopped
- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional toppings: sliced vegetables, tofu, cooked chicken, or shrimp

**Instructions:**

1. **Boil the Noodles:**
   - Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Add a pinch of salt to the water.
   - Add the noodles to the boiling water and cook according to the package instructions until they are al dente (usually around 3-5 minutes). Be careful not to overcook them. 
   - Once done, drain the noodles and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set them aside.

2. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), and sesame oil (if using). Set aside.

3. **Cook the Aromatics:**
   - Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat.

4. **Combine Noodles and Sauce:**
   - Add the cooked noodles to the pan with the garlic and green onions. Toss them gently to combine.

5. **Add the Sauce:**
   - Pour the sauce mixture over the noodles. Use a spatula or tongs to toss everything together, ensuring the noodles are evenly coated with the sauce. 

6. **Season and Customize:**
   - Taste the noodles and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add more soy sauce, salt, or pepper according to your taste.

7. **Optional Add-ins:**
   - If you want to add extra ingredients like vegetables, tofu, cooked chicken, or shrimp, this is the time to do it. Just toss them in and cook for a few minutes until they're heated through.

8. **Serve:**
   - Once everything is heated and well combined, remove the pan from heat.
   - Serve the noodles hot, garnished with additional green onions or any other toppings you prefer.
