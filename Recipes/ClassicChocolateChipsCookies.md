1 cup packed brown sugar

2 large eggs

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

3 cups all-purpose flour

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy.

Drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
