2-3 green cardamom pods

2-3 cloves

1-inch cinnamon stick

Salt to taste

For the vegetable mixture:


1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, potatoes, beans, etc.), chopped

2 tablespoons oil or ghee

1 large onion, thinly sliced

2 tomatoes, chopped

1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste

1/2 cup plain yogurt

1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)

1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder

1 teaspoon garam masala

1 teaspoon cumin seeds

Salt to taste

Fresh coriander leaves for garnish

For garnish (optional):

Fried onions

Chopped fresh mint leaves

Chopped fresh coriander leaves

# Instructions:

# Preparation:

Wash the Basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak it in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.
Boil 2 cups of water in a large pot. Add the soaked and drained rice along with bay leaf, green cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt. Cook until the rice is 70-80% cooked. Drain and set aside.
Cooking Vegetables:

In a large skillet or pot, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
Add sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.
Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until the raw smell disappears.
Add chopped tomatoes, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil starts to separate.
Adding Vegetables:

Add the chopped mixed vegetables and sauté for a few minutes.
Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the vegetables cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Layering:

Once the vegetables are cooked, spread half of the vegetable mixture in the pot evenly.
Layering Rice:

Layer the partially cooked rice on top of the vegetable mixture.
Adding Yogurt and Spices:

In a small bowl, mix yogurt, garam masala, and a pinch of saffron threads (if available). Spread this mixture evenly over the rice.
Final Layer:

Spread the remaining vegetable mixture over the rice.
Final Cooking:

Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to cook completely.

# Garnish:

Garnish with fried onions, chopped mint leaves, and fresh coriander leaves if desired.

# Serve:

Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving. Serve hot with yogurt or raita.
Enjoy your delicious Vegetable Biryani!
